> You should not use software that have not been officially licensed because it could lead to potential conflicts in how the software was advertised to be used and how the author meant for the software to be used. Down the road, you may hit roadblocks if you plan to distribute a modified version of the original software. Always use licensed software to guarantee its certification.

> I do agree with this claim that people should release their software early and let others build on and improve the code. I think this fosters a more engaged community and also helps to generate better implementations since many people would be contributing as opposed to a single team imposing their narrow-focused ideas. However, I don't believe people should just put out sloppy code and expect others to implement the features for them. I think people should at least have a solid foundation (meaning at least have the main implementation completed) and then allow others to contribute for modification.
