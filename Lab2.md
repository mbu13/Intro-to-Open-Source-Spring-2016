> It is important to choose a license because licenses explicity state to its users how the product can be used. In addition, licences help guarantee the legitimacy of how the software was intended to be used.

> You should not use software that have not been officially licensed because it could lead to potential conflicts in how the software was advertised to be used and how the author meant for the software to be used. Down the road, you may hit roadblocks if you plan to distribute a modified version of the original software. Always use licensed software to guarantee its certification. (By default, non licensed software is proprietary)

> I do agree with this claim that people should release their software early and let others build on and improve the code. I think this fosters a more engaged community and also helps to generate better implementations since many people would be contributing as opposed to a single team imposing their narrow-focused ideas. However, I don't believe people should just put out sloppy code and expect others to implement the features for them. I think people should at least have a solid foundation (meaning at least have the main implementation completed) and then allow others to contribute for modification.

> For the common good, the GPL license would be a better option. The GPL offers a wider range of freedom and also requires that its derivative works also be GPL, thus modified versions will also be free and public. For a developer, the LGPL would be ideal because it offers flexibility with libraries and still allows them to keep code proprietary and do not have to be released. For companies, the Apache/BSD license would be the better option since it allows them to modify code but keep the modification proprietary. This would help companies make profit on derived software.
