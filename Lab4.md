We fixed a spelling error of Von Neumann's name and submitted a bug fix with the diff file.

Documentation is extremely important for extensibility and maintenance. By documenting exactly how a software is meant to be used and how it is implemented, other developers will be able to gain insight as to what is expected by the users, and in the case of finding bugs, developers will be able to easily identify discrepancies and fix the errors. I learned that maintaining a good documentation is as important as the product itself as it will help people understand and fix any potential problems in your product.
