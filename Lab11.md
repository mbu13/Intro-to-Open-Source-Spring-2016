  The service acts like most other communication software. There are various "channels" that users can join either openly or by invite. Just like Slack, theis service provides ease of access to other people and enables more efficient and expedient communication of ideas.

#PART 2

Slack - the community is very motivated and demonstrates very professional behavior. Whenever people have questions, people answer with sincerity and clarity. The various channels offer different places to participate in respective topics/courses. Overall, the Slack channel is welcoming and useful.

  There isn't much activity, but it seems like a useful way to stay organized and get involved in various channels.

  This seems much more active and people are contributing much more frequently.
  
Part 3)

  OpenMRS seems like a useful and versatile tool for communicating. It's also specifically designed for medical records, so we can be certain that there is a level of security involved. For me, security is also a crucial aspect of any communication tool. If any message can be easily decoded or intercepted, then the service that the message is being sent through has a huge flaw. This also leads us to question whether popular messaging and communicating software should ever be open source. If hashcodes and encryption keys are given to the public, that would defeat the purpose of the encryption.
  
#PART4

   I agree that generally people should share common coding styles, so that extensibility is promoted and it would be easier for others to read and review another's code. At the same time, however, I think people should maintain their own styles. Their individuaity helps to make their code unique while identifying the code as theirs. Also, certain styles may be limiting. If everyone codes the same way, some more efficient coding practices and methods may be overlooked.
