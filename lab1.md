> 2) i. When asking questions, provide a useful and detailed context. For instance, if you are asking about a compile time error, provide details regarding the language you are using, the snippet of code that you think is causing the error, and other potentially relevent details needed for people to answer the question.

> ii. As the questioner, be open-minded toward suggestions. Most people who try to answer your questions are doing their best to help you resolve a problem, but if you are narrow-minded and only accept solutions that seem right to you (when there could be better solutions), people will find you very difficult to work with.
